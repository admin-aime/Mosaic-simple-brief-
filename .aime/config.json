  "summary": "A comprehensive leadership style assessment platform built with React that evaluates users across five key leadership dimensions: Transformational, Transactional, Servant, Authentic, and Situational leadership. Following the AIME Method, we've defined target users (professionals, HR teams, admins), core functions (assessment engine, reporting, user management), user experiences (assessment flow, admin interface), data structures (user profiles, assessments, results), business rules (scoring algorithms, development recommendations), and API services (assessment and user management endpoints). The platform provides detailed analysis, personalized development recommendations, and progress tracking to help users understand and improve their leadership effectiveness.",
