# Lessons Learned

## User Specified Lessons
(No lessons documented yet)

## AIME Learned  
- Using localStorage for data persistence in a leadership assessment platform provides immediate functionality for users while maintaining simplicity. For production deployment, consider implementing proper backend APIs with database storage for scalability and data security.
- The combination of scenario-based questions and Likert scale responses provides more accurate leadership style assessment than simple self-rating questions. Including real workplace scenarios helps users provide more authentic responses.
